# Project---2
Gesture Recognition is a Machine Learning project using Tensorflow, Mediapipe, and ML Algorithms which helps users to predict the gestures and sign language enabling easy communication for the differently abled. It includes video processing and training videos by converting into numpy arrays with a training accuracy ranging between 80% - 85%.
